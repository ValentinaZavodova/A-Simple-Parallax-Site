	<h2>AMOUR</h2>
	<p class="first">Paris was a universe whole and entire unto herself, hollowed and fashioned by history. Even the majestic trees that graced and sheltered her streets were attuned to her–and the waters of the Seine, contained and beautiful as they wound through her heart.</p>

	<h2>JE T’AIME!</h2>
	<p class="second">I love the night passionately. I love it as I love my country, or my lover, with an instinctive, deep, and unshakeable love. I love it with all my senses: I love to see it, I love to breathe it in, I love to open my ears to its silence, I love my whole body to be caressed by its blackness. </p>
